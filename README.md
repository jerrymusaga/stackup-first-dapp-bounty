# Quest start and end time
This new feature added are the quest start and end times, along with corresponding functionality to enforce restrictions on joining quests and submitting quests based on these time constraints.The addition of quest start and end times allows for more control over quest availability and submission. By specifying the start and end times for each quest, it becomes possible to prevent users from joining quests that have already ended or have not yet started and submitting quest when the deadline has reached. This ensures fairness and prevents users from participating for rewards and submission of quests outside the designated time window.
The functionality works by including startTime and endTime fields in the Quest struct. When creating or editing a quest, the admin can set these time constraints. The canJoinQuest modifier is applied to the joinQuest function, which checks if the current timestamp falls within the start and end times of the quest. If the quest is not available to join based on the current time, an error is thrown. And a require check is also added to the submit function to make sure there is no submission after the deadline is reached. Overall, this new feature enhance the control and management of quests by introducing time restrictions, making the quest system more robust and providing a better user experience. I tested the functionality after calculating the unix timestamp from this website https://www.unixtimestamp.com/index.php

# Edit and delete quests
The functionalities of editing and deleting quests provide flexibility and control to the admin over the quests created. The edit quest functionality allows the admin to modify the details of an existing quest. The admin can update the quest's title, reward, number of rewards, start time, and end time. This feature ensures that the admin can adapt and refine quests based on changing requirements or circumstances.
On the other hand, the delete quest functionality empowers the admin to remove a quest from the system entirely. This capability is useful in scenarios where a quest needs removal for any reason. Deleting quests helps to keep the quest collection organized and up-to-date.
Both functionalities contribute to the overall manageability and maintenance of the quest system.
